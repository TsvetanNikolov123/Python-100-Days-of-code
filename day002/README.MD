# 🧮 Day 2 – Tip Calculator Project

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, I built a simple **tip calculator** that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including the tip percentage.

---

## 💡 What it does:

- Takes the total bill amount as input.
- Takes the number of people splitting the bill.
- Takes the tip percentage.
- Calculates the total amount per person including the tip.
- Formats the result to 2 decimal places for currency display.
