# 🗺️ Day 3 – Treasure Island: Choose Your Own Adventure Game

## 📝 Project Description

This project is a simple **text-based adventure game** where the player makes choices that lead to different outcomes. The goal is to find the hidden treasure on a mysterious island.

The game uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements based on a decision tree to create a branching storyline.

## 🕹️ How it works:

- The game presents the user with multiple choices:
  - Left or right?
  - Swim or wait?
  - Which door: red, yellow, or blue?
- Each decision leads to a different outcome (win or game over)
- The game ends when the player finds the treasure or makes a wrong move
